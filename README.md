# Kotlin Script Beans for Spring plugin

<!-- Plugin description -->
Adds support for .beans.kts files.
Use it along with <a href="https://github.com/mrvanish97/kotlin-dsl-beans-extended">kotlin-dsl-beans-extended</a> added to your Spring Boot project to define declarative beans using Kotlin language.

Since I still cannot get plugin approved on JetBrains Marketplace, on each release, I will attach a `.zip` archive with plugin to install manually in Intellij IDEA
